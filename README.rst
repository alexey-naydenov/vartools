VarTools
--------

VarTools is a set of utilities for VarTrace logs parsing and conversion.

Because VarTrace stores only numerical data without any textual
information it is difficult to interpret it. This set of functions in
addition to converting binary stream into text form can extract
description of data values from C++ headers and add them to the output
to help interpretation by a human.
